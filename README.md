game-of-life
------------

This repo contains the Conway's Game of Life written in different languages.

Since the game of life is a pretty nice programming excercise, I decided to write it
in some of the languages I am using right now or I want to use.

Details can be found in the respective repositories. Some of the implementations are not
finished, nor nice.

Languages
---------
- [x] C - plain old C implementation
- [X] C++ - not really needed, since C is compiled using cc
- [x] Java - console/JavaFX implementation
- [ ] Javascript - Typescript experiment, not finished
- [ ] ASM - future maybe
- [ ] PHP - future maybe
